
  WEYL Refresh TODO

- Implement everythig in terms of the ANSI standard.
- Rename all functions that do not conform to the conventions in the
  ANSI standard. i.e. minus? -> minusp.
- Better organize the generic functions defintions, probably in an
  interface file.
- Better separate the definitions in WEYL from WEYLI.
- Implement custom errors.
